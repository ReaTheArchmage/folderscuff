An easy to use searchbar, connected to your custom folder, that will automatically open any file or link in it when you write the exact name of it, without the need to click enter. If no results occur you'll be able to search the string on your browser, allowing you to obtain an instant LLM response. For any question reach out to me, bye bye.
